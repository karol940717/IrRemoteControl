This is an Android application for controlling a TV or amplifier using a phone's built-in infrared transmitter. The application allows the user to send power toggle and OK button commands to a TV or power toggle and volume up commands to an amplifier using specific IR hex codes. The codes have been tested on specific TV and amplifier models and may not work with other devices. The application also uses the ConsumerIrManager class to transmit the IR signals.
